                    has surpassed many amilestone. From setting up an institution that imparts quality education, 
                    to emerging as a centre for knowledge and academic excellence in several spheres of learning, 
                    the trust has made many successful strides along the journey. Over the years, the number of parents 
                    entrusting their children to us has only grown, so we nurture citizens who can create a place for themselves 
                    as the leaders of their own future.From just a boarding school in 1992 to a business school today, we have come past many 
                    milestones in every sphere of general and professional education. Providing the necessary support, the best curriculum, top-notch 
                    infrastructure, we have influenced learning that happens at every level, in every classroom. Continuing our belief in the thought 
                    that a strong body makes the mind strong; we balance academic perfection with physical agility.
                    As we move ahead on the path we started, we have been trying to introduce newer realms of education, newer practices 
                    and approaches, newer curriculum, while bettering the existing ones  so we groom a generation of children who are ready to create their own world.
